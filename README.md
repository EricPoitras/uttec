LOOK AND FEEL IS READY!!!

TO DO LIST

1) Add evaluation form via iframe (wait for Lauren)
2) Add script to handle conversation back and forth with agent through API.AI server - explore the use of webhooks/variables for logging purposes (wait for Lauren)
3) Set up a virtual private server with PHP and MySQL to log user interaction data (any reservation against me hosting this myself, otherwise Aaron you may want to consider paying for an account and url address; I could recommend free hosting services, but you probably dont want to risk it given the loss of data if the account goes inactive, which is typical of most service agreements. AWS might offer a free service given your traffic would probably be low enough; however, I dont have any experience in setting up databases with them, might be too complicated.)
4) Set up Google Analytics and MouseFlow integration for data logging purposes (to complement the database - free services for basic analytics data for traffic and usability)
