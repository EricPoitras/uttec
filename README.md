LOOK AND FEEL IS READY!!!

TO DO LIST
- Add evaluation form via iframe (wait for Lauren)
- Set up a virtual private server with PHP that allows for writing JSON docs on the backend
- Set up Google Analytics and MouseFlow integration for data logging purposes (to complement the database - free services for basic analytics data for traffic and usability)
